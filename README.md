# Jamf3Pureservice

Dette er en noe unødvendig stor Laravel-installasjon ment for å synke [Jamf Pro](https://jamf.com) med [Pureservice Assets](https://pureservice.com).

** Dokumentasjonen er under oppretting… **

## Requirements
* A Jamf Pro instance
* A Pureservice instance
* Pureservice Assets setup to include two asset types: Computers and Mobile devices (more on that later)
* PHP 8.x and PHP composer

## Installation

In order to get this up and running, start with cloning the repository.
